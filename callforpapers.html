                24th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Formal Methods and Models for System Design
            </h4>

            <p>
                On its 24th edition, MEMOCODE, originally a forum on methods and models for hardware-software codesign, 
                has become a privileged forum to discuss formal methods and models for the design of cyber-physical 
                systems and the verification of their safety and security requirements.

                MEMOCODE brings together researchers and practitioners interested in formal methods for system design 
                and development, to exchange ideas, research results, and lessons learned. The symposium focuses on the 
                foundations and applications of formal methods in the development of hardware, firmware, middleware, and 
                application software for systems, ranging from single embedded devices to highly networked cyber-physical 
                systems and the Internet of Things.
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
            <p>
                MEMOCODE solicits research papers on formal methods in system design that address the foundations, engineering methods, tools, or experimental case studies.
                Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

            <h2>Submissions</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://memocode2026.github.io/">MEMOCODE 2026</a> calls for three kinds of submissions: <b>Regular Papers</b>, <b>Late-Breaking Results</b>, and <b>Tool Presentations</b>.
                All papers must be written in English and formatted according to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates"><b>IEEE Computer Society</b> guidelines</a>.
                A <b>double-blind review process</b> will be enforced, and authors must not reveal their identity directly or indirectly.
                Submission of papers is handled via <a href="https://memocode26.hotcrp.com/">HotCRP</a>.
                <span class="comment">HotCRP site has been created, not completed.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware of <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/">IEEE's submission policies</a>, particularly around multiple submissions and the usage of AI.
                Submission of work that has previously been published, accepted, or is under review at another publication, is not allowed.
                The usage of AI should be disclosed as part of the acknowledgments section, in accordance with the guidelines.
                <span class="comment">Added the above to clarify AI and simultaneous submission.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                All accepted papers (regular papers, tool papers, and late-breaking papers) will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements.
                Publication in the proceedings is contingent on one author registering for and presenting the paper at the symposium.
            </p>

            <h3>Regular Papers</h3>
            <p>
                Regular papers are no longer than ten (10) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices.
                They should describe original work that does not overlap with another publication or a submission under review or accepted for publication by any other conference or journal.
                Reviewers will check regular papers for the soundness and novelty of the proposed solutions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Tool Papers</h3>
            <p>
                Tool papers are no longer than eight (8) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices.
                They should describe an existing and publicly available tool that implements relevant methods.
                The methods might have been published before, but the tool should not have been described in a tool paper previously.
                In addition to reviewing the paper, reviewers will assess the tool itself using inputs and a user's manual provided by the authors on the tool's web page.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Late-Breaking (LB) Papers</h3>
            <p>
                Late-breaking papers are no longer than four (4) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices.
                They should describe a promising and novel idea with a potential to get breakthrough in the field.
                Reviewers will judge the novelty of the idea, but do not yet expect proofs for the envisioned results.
            </p>

            <h3>Journal-First Track</h3>
            <p>
                MEMOCODE regularly produces a special issue of <b>ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (ACM TECS)</b> which selects the best papers presented at the symposium along with other outstanding contributions within its scope.
                This year, MEMOCODE will select and invite the best soon to-be-published articles from its <a href="https://dl.acm.org/pb-assets/static_journal_pages/tecs/pdf/ACM-TECS-SI_MEMOCODE25-1765395232697.pdf">2025 special issue</a> for presentation at the symposium.
                <span class="comment">Added Journal-First Track based on JP / Partha's suggestion</span>
            </p>
            <p></p>

            <h2>Outstanding Paper Award</h2>
            <p>
                A selection of papers will be recognized as <b>Outstanding Papers</b> and highlighted on the symposium website.
            </p>

            <!-- <h2>Journal Special Issue</h2>
            <p>
                Selected accepted papers will be invited to extend their accepted papers (at least 30% additional content) for a special issue in the <b>ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (ACM TECS)</b>.
                Authors must follow the call for submissions for the special edition to check deadlines and the timeline of the review process.
                The extended version will undergo a separate review process in the journal.
